# Characters of Rick & Morty



I've used web components, vanilla JS and the [Rick & Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to display some of the characters from the show. 



You can intially see the first 20 characters from the show, and see more by clicking *Load More*. You can also filter characters by name.


## Getting started

- Fork the repo and clone onto your local machine
- Install the dependencies by running ```npm i```
- Start the app by running ```npm start```
